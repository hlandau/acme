== Introduction & Design Philosophy

acmetool is an easy-to-use command line tool for automatically acquiring
TLS certificates from ACME servers such as Let’s Encrypt, designed to
flexibly integrate into your webserver setup to enable automatic
verification.

*Non-interference.* Unlike the official Let’s Encrypt client, this
doesn’t modify your web server configuration.

*Target-oriented and idempotent.* acmetool is designed to work like
``make'': you specify what certificates you want, and acmetool obtains
certificates as necessary to satisfy those requirements. If the
requirements are already satisfied, acmetool doesn’t do anything when
invoked. Thus, acmetool is ideally suited for use on a cron job; it will
do nothing until certificates are near expiry, and then obtain new ones.

*Clear and minimal state.* acmetool is designed to minimise the use of
state and be transparent in the state that it does use. All state,
including certificates, is stored in a single directory, by default
`/var/lib/acme`. The schema for this directory is simple, comprehensible
and
https://github.com/hlandau/acmetool/blob/master/_doc/SCHEMA.md[documented.]

*Stable filenames.* The certificate for a given hostname `example.com`
always lives at `/var/lib/acme/live/example.com/{cert,chain,privkey}`.
This is a symlink to the real certificate directory and gets changed as
certificates are renewed.

*Fully automatic renewal.* acmetool can automatically reload your
webserver when it changes the target of a `live` symlink. In conjunction
with acmetool’s use of stable filenames and idempotent design, this
means that renewal can be fully automatic.

*Flexible validation methods.* acmetool supports six different
validation methods:

* *Webroot:* acmetool places challenge files in a given directory,
allowing your normal web server to serve them. You must ensure the
directory is served at `/.well-known/acme-challenge/`.
* *Proxy:* When acmetool needs to validate for a domain, it temporarily
spins up a built-in web server on port 402 or 4402 (if being used under
the non-root validation mode). You configure your web server to proxy
requests for `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` to this server at the same
path.
* *Stateless:* You configure your webserver to respond statelessly to
challenges for a given account key without consulting acmetool. This
requires nothing more than a one-time web server configuration change
and no ``moving parts''.
* *Redirector:* If the only thing you want to do with port 80 is
redirect people to port 443, you can use acmetool’s built in redirector
HTTP server. You must ensure that your existing web server does not
listen on port 80. acmetool redirects requests to HTTPS, but its control
of port 80 ensures it can complete validation.
* *Listen:* Listen on port 80 or 443. This is only really useful for
development purposes.
* *Hook:* You can write custom shell scripts or binary executables which
acmetool invokes to provision challenges at the desired location.

*Non-root operation.* If you don’t want to trust acmetool, you can setup
acmetool to operate without running as root. If you don’t have root
access to a system, you may still be able to use acmetool by configuring
it to use a local directory and webroot mode.

*Designed for automation.* acmetool is designed to be fully automatable.
Response files allow you to run the quickstart wizard automatically.

[[installation]]
== Installation

You can install acmetool by building from source or by using a binary
release. Both are easy.

*Installing: using binary releases.*
https://github.com/hlandau/acmetool/releases[Binary releases are found
here.] Unpack, copy the binary to `/usr/local/bin/acmetool` (or wherever
you like), and you’re done.

`_cgo` releases are preferred over non-`_cgo` releases where available,
but non-`_cgo` releases may be more compatible with older OSes. (The
main drawback of non-`_cgo` releases is that they exhibit reduced
functionality in relation to privilege dropping and daemonization
functionality for the redirector daemon.)

*Installing: Ubuntu users.* A binary release PPA, `ppa:hlandau/rhea`
(package `acmetool`) is available.

[source,sh]
----
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:hlandau/rhea
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install acmetool
----

You can also
https://launchpad.net/~hlandau/+archive/ubuntu/rhea/+packages[download
.deb files manually.]

(Note: There is no difference between the .deb files for different
Ubuntu release codenames; they are interchangeable and completely
equivalent.)

*Installing: Debian users.* The Ubuntu binary release PPA also works
with Debian:

....
# echo 'deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/hlandau/rhea/ubuntu xenial main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rhea.list
# apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 9862409EF124EC763B84972FF5AC9651EDB58DFA
# apt-get update
# apt-get install acmetool
....

You can also
https://launchpad.net/~hlandau/+archive/ubuntu/rhea/+packages[download
.deb files manually.]

(Note: There is no difference between the .deb files for different
Ubuntu release codenames; they are interchangeable and completely
equivalent.)

*Installing: RPM-based distros:*
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/hlandau/acmetool/[A copr RPM
repository is available.]

If you have `dnf` installed:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo dnf copr enable hlandau/acmetool
$ sudo dnf install acmetool
----

Otherwise use the `.repo` files on the
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/hlandau/acmetool/[repository
page] and use `yum`, or download RPMs and use `rpm` directly.

*Installing: Arch Linux users.*
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/acmetool-git/[An AUR PKGBUILD for
building from source is available.]

[source,sh]
----
$ wget https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/acmetool-git.tar.gz
$ tar xvf acmetool-git.tar.gz
$ cd acmetool-git
$ makepkg -s
$ sudo pacman -U ./acmetool*.pkg.tar.xz
----

*Installing: Alpine Linux users.*
https://github.com/hlandau/acmetool/blob/master/_doc/contrib/APKBUILD[An APKBUILD
for building from source is available.]

*Installing: from source.* Clone, make, make install. You will need Go
1.5.2 or later installed to build from source.

If you are using Linux, you will need to make sure the development files
for `libcap` are installed. This is probably a package for your distro
called `libcap-dev` or `libcap-devel` or similar.

[source,sh]
----
# This is necesary to work around a change in Git's default configuration
# which hasn't yet been accounted for in some places.
$ git config --global http.followRedirects true

$ git clone https://github.com/hlandau/acmetool
$ cd acmetool
$ make && sudo make install
----

*Installing: from source (existing GOPATH).* The Makefile is intended to
make things easy for users unfamiliar with Go packaging conventions. If
you know what a GOPATH is and have one set up, you can and should
instead simply do:

[source,sh]
----
$ git config --global http.followRedirects true
$ go get -u github.com/hlandau/acme/cmd/acmetool
$ sudo cp $GOPATH/bin/acmetool /usr/local/bin/acmetool
----

(Note: Although use of cgo is recommended, building without cgo is
supported.)

[[after-installation]]
== After installation

*Initial configuration.* Having installed acmetool, run the quickstart
wizard for a guided setup. You may wish to ensure you have `dialog` in
your PATH, but acmetool will fallback to basic stdio prompts if it’s not
available.

[source,sh]
----
$ sudo acmetool quickstart
----

If you don’t want to run acmetool as root, see the
link:#annex-root-configured-non-root-operation[non-root setup guide].

Pass `--expert` to quickstart if you want to choose what key parameters
to use (RSA or ECDSA, RSA key size, ECDSA curve). By default 2048-bit
RSA is used.

If you want to automate the quickstart process, see the section on
response files below.

It is safe to rerun quickstart at any time.

*Configuring your web server.* Once you’ve completed the quickstart, you
should configure your web server as necessary to enable validation. See
the _Web server configuration_ section below.

*Obtaining certificates.* Once everything’s ready, simply run:

[source,sh]
----
$ sudo acmetool want example.com www.example.com
----

This adds a target desiring a certificate for hostnames `example.com`
and `www.example.com`. You can specify as many hostnames (SANs) as you
like. Whenever you run acmetool in the future, it’ll make sure that a
certificate for these hostnames is available and not soon to expire.

acmetool lumps hostnames together in the same certificate. If you want
`example.com` and `www.example.com` to be separate certificates, use
separate `want` commands to configure them as separate targets:

[source,sh]
----
$ sudo acmetool want example.com
$ sudo acmetool want www.example.com
----

If all went well, your certificate should be available at
`/var/lib/acme/live/example.com`. This is a directory containing PEM
files `cert`, `chain`, `fullchain` and `privkey`. The use of these files
varies by application; typically you will use only a subset of these
files.

*Troubleshooting.* If all didn’t go well, you might find it helpful to
run with debug logging:

[source,sh]
----
$ sudo acmetool --xlog.severity=debug
----

(There’s no need to run ``want'' again; the targets are recorded even if
reconciliation is not successful.)

*Auto-renewal.* acmetool offers to install a cronjob during the
quickstart process. This simply runs `acmetool --batch`, which will
idempotently ensure that all configured targets are satisfied by
certificates not soon to expire. (`--batch` here ensures that acmetool
doesn’t try to ask any questions.)

*Auto-renewal: reloading your webserver.* When acmetool refreshes a
certificate, it changes the symlink in `live` and executes hook scripts
to reload your web server or do whatever you want. Specifically, it
executes any executable files in `/usr/lib/acme/hooks` (or
`/usr/libexec/acme/hooks` if on a distro that uses libexec). You can
drop your own executable files here, and acmetool will invoke them when
it changes certificates. (For information on the calling convention, see
https://github.com/hlandau/acmetool/blob/master/_doc/SCHEMA.md#notification-hooks[SCHEMA.md].)

`acmetool quickstart` installs some default hooks applicable to common
webservers. These hooks contain the string `#!acmetool-managed!#`.
acmetool reserves the right to overwrite any file containing this string
with a newer version of the script, in the event that the default
scripts are updated in subsequent versions of acmetool. If you make
changes to a default script and do not wish them to be overwritten, you
should remove this line to ensure that your changes are not overwritten.
However, note that the default hook scripts are designed to be
configurable and it will be rare that you need to modify the scripts
themselves. If you encounter a situation where you need to change the
script itself, you may consider whether it would be appropriate to file
an enhancement request. The string `#!acmetool-managed!#` must be
present near the start of the file in order to be detected.

If you want to disable a default hook entirely, you should replace it
with an empty file rather than deleting it, as `acmetool quickstart`
will automatically install absent default hooks.

*Default hook scripts: the `reload` hook.* The reload hook is a default
hook installed by `acmetool quickstart`. It reloads a list of services
using commands specific to the distro. The correct command is detected
automatically; `service $SERVICE reload`, `systemctl reload $SERVICE`,
and `/etc/init.d/$SERVICE reload` are supported.

A default list of services is provided which includes the most common
webserver service names. This list can be customised using the `reload`
hook configuration file.

The `reload` hook configuration file is located at
`/etc/conf.d/acme-reload` or `/etc/default/acme-reload`; the correct
path depends on the conventions of your distro. It is a sourced shell
file which can modify the default configuration variables of the
`reload` script. Currently, the only variable is the `SERVICES`
variable, a space-separated list of service names.

You can overwrite the services list outright, or append to it like so:

[source,sh]
----
# Example reload hook configuration file adding a service to the list of
# services to be restarted.
SERVICES="$SERVICES cherokee"
----

*Default hook scripts: the `haproxy` hook.* The haproxy hook is a
default hook which `acmetool quickstart` can optionally install. It only
offers to install this hook if HAProxy is detected as being installed on
the system.

HAProxy is rather bizarre in its TLS configuration requirements; it
requires certificates and private key to be appended together in the
same file. `acmetool` does not support this natively and is unlikely
ever to as a default configuration for security reasons. Instead, the
`haproxy` hook creates the necessary files for HAProxy from the
certificate and private key files whenever they are updated. Thus,
additional copies of the private key are only made when necessary to
support HAProxy.

*Inside the state directory.* acmetool aims to minimise the use of state
and be transparent about the state it does keep. When you run
`acmetool want`, acmetool does these things:

* It configures a new target by writing a YAML file to
`/var/lib/acme/desired/` describing the desired hostnames.
* It runs the default command, `reconcile`, to ensure that all targets
are met.

To demonstrate, you can replicate the function of `acmetool want`:

[source,sh]
----
$ sudo touch /var/lib/acme/desired/example.com
$ sudo acmetool
----

Target files live in the `desired` directory. An empty target file
defaults to its filename as the target hostname.

https://github.com/hlandau/acmetool/blob/master/_doc/SCHEMA.md[More
information on the format of the acmetool state directory and target
files.]

[[web-server-configuration-challenges]]
== Web server configuration: challenges

What web server configuration you need to do depends on the validation
method you have selected.

*Redirector mode.* No configuration required, but ensure that your web
server is not listening on port 80 and that the redirector service
(`acmetool redirector --service.daemon --service.uid=`__uid-to-drop-privileges-to__)
is started.

*Proxy mode: nginx/tengine.* You can configure nginx/tengine for use
with acmetool in proxy mode as follows:

[source,nginx]
----
http {
  server {
    ... your configuration ...

    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
      proxy_pass http://acmetool;
    }
  }

  upstream acmetool {
    # (Change to port 4402 if using non-root mode.)
    server 127.0.0.1:402;
  }
}
----

This configuration will need to be repeated for each vhost. You may wish
to avoid duplication by placing the applicable configuration in a
separate file and including it in each vhost.

*Proxy mode: Apache httpd.*

[source,apache]
----
# (Change to port 4402 if using non-root mode.)
ProxyPass "/.well-known/acme-challenge" "http://127.0.0.1:402/.well-known/acme-challenge"
----

Ensure you load the modules `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_http`.

*Proxy mode: Changing port.* If you need to change the ports on which
acmetool listens, see the `request: challenge: http-ports` directive.
See link:#the-state-storage-schema[State storage schema].

*Webroot mode.* If you don’t have a particular webroot path in mind,
consider using `/var/run/acme/acme-challenge` as a recommended standard.
`acmetool` defaults to this as a webroot path if you don’t explicitly
configure one. (See ``Challenge Completion Philosophy'' below.)

*Webroot mode: nginx/tengine.*

[source,nginx]
----
http {
  server {
    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
      alias /var/run/acme/acme-challenge/;
    }
  }
}
----

Note that the configuration will need to be repeated for each vhost. You
may wish to avoid duplication by placing the applicable configuration in
a separate file and including it in each vhost.

*Webroot mode: Apache httpd.*

[source,apache]
----
Alias "/.well-known/acme-challenge/" "/var/run/acme/acme-challenge/"
<Directory "/var/run/acme/acme-challenge">
  AllowOverride None
  Options None

  # If using Apache 2.4+
  Require all granted

  # If using Apache 2.2 and lower
  Order allow, deny
  Allow from all
</Directory>
----

*Hook mode.* See link:#challenge-hooks[Challenge Hooks].

*Stateless mode.* In stateless mode, you configure your webserver to
respond to challenge requests without consulting acmetool. A single
account key is nominated. This is one of the most reliable and least
error-prone methods for simple cases.

*Stateless mode: nginx/Tengine.*

Replace `ACCOUNT_THUMBPRINT` in the example below with your account
thumbprint. You can retrieve your account thumbprint by running
`acmetool account-thumbprint`. The first part of each line output is the
account thumbprint.

[source,nginx]
----
http {
  server {
    location ~ "^/\.well-known/acme-challenge/([-_a-zA-Z0-9]+)$" {
      default_type text/plain;
      return 200 "$1.ACCOUNT_THUMBPRINT";
    }
  }
}
----

*Stateless mode: Apache.* It does not appear that the configuration
system of Apache can currently express the needed behaviour.

[[web-server-configuration-tls]]
== Web server configuration: TLS

Mozilla has a
https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/[TLS
configuration generator] that you can use to generate configurations for
common web servers.

[[challenge-completion-philosophy]]
== Challenge completion philosophy

acmetool’s philosophy to completing challenges is to try absolutely
anything that might work. So long as _something_ works, acmetool doesn’t
care what it was that worked. When `acmetool quickstart` asks you what
method to use, this is asked purely to determine a) whether to ask you
for a webroot path (if you selected webroot mode) and b) whether to ask
you if you want to install the redirector service (if you selected
redirector mode and are using systemd, for which automatic service
installation is supported). It doesn’t determine what strategies
acmetool does or doesn’t use, so it’s normal to see log output relating
to a failure to use methods other than the one you chose.

acmetool always tries to listen on port 402 and 4402 when completing
challenges, in case something proxies to it. It always tries to listen
on ports 80 and 443, in case you’re not running a webserver yet. And it
always tries to place challenge files in any webroot paths you have
configured. Finally, it always tries to place challenge files in
`/var/run/acme/acme-challenge`; this serves as a standard location for
challenge files, and the redirector daemon works by looking here.

Failure to complete any of these efforts is non-fatal. Ultimately, all
acmetool cares about is that a challenge completes successfully after
having attempted all possible preparations. It doesn’t know or care
_why_ a challenge succeeds, only that it succeeded.

(For HTTP-based challenges, acmetool self-tests its ability to complete
the challenge by issuing a request for the same URL which will be
requested by the ACME server, and does not proceed if this does not
validate. Thus, HTTP-based challenges will never work if you are running
some sort of weird split-horizon configuration where challenge files are
retrievable only from the internet but not the local machine.)

[[the-state-storage-schema]]
== The state storage schema

https://github.com/hlandau/acmetool/blob/master/_doc/SCHEMA.md[The format of
acmetool’s state directory is authoritatively documented here.] What
follows is a summary of the more important parts.

*`live` directory:* Contains symlinks from hostnames to certificate
directories. Each certificate directory contains `cert`, `chain`,
`fullchain` and `privkey` files. (If you are using HAProxy and have
chosen to install the HAProxy hook script, a `haproxy` file will also be
available containing key, certificate and chain all in one.)

You should configure your web server in terms of paths like
`/var/lib/acme/live/example.com/{cert,chain,fullchain,privkey}`.

*`desired` directory:* Contains targetfiles. These determine the
certificates which will be requested. Each target file is a YAML file,
split into two principal sections: the `satisfy` section and the
`request` section.

The `satisfy` section dictates what conditions must be met in order for
a certificate to meet a target (and thus be selected for symlinking
under the `live` directory). The `request` section dictates the
parameters for requesting new certificates, but nothing under it
determines _whether_ a certificate is requested.

Finally, the `priority` value determines which target is used for a
hostname when there are multiple targets for the same hostname. Higher
priorities take precedence. The default priority is 0.

In most cases, you will set only `satisfy.names` in a target file, and
will set all other settings in the _default target file_, which is
located at `conf/target`. The quickstart wizard sets this file up for
you. All settings in the default target file are inherited by targets,
but can be overridden individually.

[source,yaml]
----
satisfy:
  names:
    - example.com       # The names you want on the certificate.
    - www.example.com

request:
  provider:               # ACME Directory URL. Normally set in conf/target only.
  ocsp-must-staple: true  # Request OCSP Must Staple. Use with care.
  challenge:
    webroot-paths:        # You can specify custom webroot paths.
      - /var/www
    http-ports:           # You can specify different ports for proxying.
      - 123               # Defaults to listening on localhost.
      - 456
      - 0.0.0.0:789       # Global listen.
    http-self-test: false # Defaults to true. If false, will not perform self-test
                          # but will assume challenge can be completed. Rarely needed.
    env:                  # Optionally set environment variables to be passed to hooks.
      FOO: BAR
  key:                    # What sort of key will be used for this certificate?
    type: rsa|ecdsa
    rsa-size: 2048
    ecdsa-curve: nistp256
    id: krzh2akn...       # If specified, the key ID to use to generate new certificates.
                          # If not specified, a new private key will always be generated.
                          # Useful for key pinning.

priority: 0
----

*HAProxy support:* If you have chosen to install the HAProxy hook
script, each certificate directory will also have a coalesced `haproxy`
file containing certificate chain and private key. There will also be a
`haproxy` directory mapping from hostnames directly to these files.

*`accounts` directory:* ACME account keys and state information. You
don’t need to worry about this.

*`certs` and `keys`*: Contains certificates and keys used to satisfy
targets. However, you should never need to reference these directories
directly.

Please note that it is a requirement that the state directory not
straddle filesystem boundaries. That is, all files under `/var/lib/acme`
must lie on the same filesystem.

[[response-files]]
== Response files

It is possible to automatically provide responses to any question
acmetool can ask.

To do this, you provide the `--response-file` flag, with the path to a
YAML file containing response information.
https://github.com/hlandau/acmetool/blob/master/_doc/contrib/response-file.yaml[An
example of such a file is here.]

If you don’t provide a `--response-file` flag, acmetool will try to look
for one at `/var/lib/acme/conf/responses`. If using a response file,
it’s recommended that you place it at this location.

The file specifies key-value pairs. Each key is a prompt ID. (You can
find these by grepping the source code for `UniqueID`.)

(For messages which simply require acknowledgement, specify `true` to
bypass them. Yes/no prompts should have a boolean value specified. The
example response file is demonstrative.)

You should specify `--batch` when using a response file to prevent
acmetool from trying to prompt the user and fail instead, in case it
tries to ask anything which you don’t have a response for in your
response file.

[[hooks]]
== Hooks

Hooks provide a means to extend acmetool with arbitrary behaviour. Hooks
are executable files installed by default at `/usr/lib/acme/hooks` (or,
on systems which use `/usr/libexec`, `/usr/libexec/acme/hooks`).

The event type is always passed as the first argument. A hook must exit
with exit code 42 for event types it doesn’t handle.

There are currently two types of hook: notification hooks and challenge
hooks.

[[notification-hooks]]
== Notification hooks

The quickstart wizard installs default notification hooks to reload
common webservers and other services after acmetool changes the
preferred certificate for a hostname. These hooks are executable shell
scripts and you can, if you wish, substitute your own. The default hooks
are good bases from which to make your own customisations.

You can use notification hooks to reload webservers, distribute
certificates and private keys to other servers, or convert certificates
and private keys into another format which is required by some daemon.
For example, HAProxy support is implemented entirely via hook.

The event type is ``live-updated''.

[[challenge-hooks]]
== Challenge hooks

In some complex use cases, it may be necessary to install HTTP challenge
files via some arbitrary programmatic means, rather than via one of the
standard methods of webroot, proxy, redirector or listener.

Challenge hooks are executed when challenge files need to be added or
removed. Your hook must be synchronous; it must exit only when the
challenge file is definitely in place and is globally accessible.

https://github.com/hlandau/acmetool/blob/master/_doc/SCHEMA.md#hooks[See the
specification for more information.]

Challenge hooks are supported for HTTP, TLS-SNI and DNS challenges.
https://hlandau.github.io/acmetool/userguide#annex-external-resources-and-third-party-extentions[A
list of third party challenge hook scripts can be found here.]

== FAQ

[[ive-selected-the-webrootproxyredirectorlistener-challenge-method-but-im-seeing-log-entries-for-other-methods-or-for-webroots-other-than-the-one-i-configured.]]
=== I’ve selected the (webroot/proxy/redirector/listener) challenge method, but I’m seeing log entries for other methods, or for webroots other than the one I configured.

This is normal. By design, acmetool always tries anything which might
work, and these errors are nonfatal as long as _something_ works. The
challenge method you select in the quickstart wizard determines only
whether to ask you for a webroot path, and whether to install the
redirector (if you are using system). The webroot path
`/var/run/acme/acme-challenge`, as a standard location, will always be
tried in addition to any webroot you specify, as will proxy and listener
mode ports.

Fore more information, see
https://hlandau.github.io/acmetool/userguide#challenge-completion-philosophy[challenge

[[annex-root-configured-non-root-operation]]
== Annex: Root-configured non-root operation

The following steps describe how you can, as root, take a series of
steps that allows you to invoke acmetool as a non-root user, thereby
limiting your attack surface and the degree to which you trust acmetool.

It is also possible to use acmetool without you having access to root at
all. In this case, place acmetool in a location of your choice and pass
the `--state` and `--hooks` flags with appropriate paths of your choice
to all invocations of acmetool.

[[rootless-setup-as-root]]
== Rootless setup as root

acmetool has experimental support for root-free operation.

In order to run root-free, after installing acmetool in `/usr/local/bin`
(or wherever you want it), before running acmetool, do the following:

* Create a new user `acme` (or whatever you want).
* Create the directory `/var/lib/acme` and change the owning user and
group to `acme`. (You can use a different directory, but you must then
make sure you pass `--state PATH` to all invocations of acmetool.)
* Create the directory `/usr/lib/acme/hooks` (`/usr/libexec/acme/hooks`
on distros which use libexec). Make it writable by `acme` for the time
being by changing the group to `acme` and making the directory
group-writable. (You can make this read-only after running the
quickstart process, which places some shell scripts in here to reload
servers. You can audit these scripts yourself or use your own if you
wish.)
* Change to the user `acme` and run `acmetool quickstart`.
+
....
$ sudo -u acme acmetool quickstart
....
+
A crontab will be installed automatically as the `acme` user; you may
wish to examine it.
** As root, make the `hooks` directory root-owned/not group writable
once more. Ensure that the scripts are root-owned:
+
[source,sh]
----
# chown -R root:root /usr/lib*/acme/hooks
# chmod 755 /usr/lib*/acme/hooks
----
+
Inspect the hook scripts if you wish. Mark the hook scripts setuid:
+
[source,sh]
----
# chmod u+s /usr/lib*/acme/hooks/*
----
+
UNIX systems don’t support setuid shell scripts, so this bit is ignored.
Rather, acmetool takes it as a flag to tell it to run these scripts via
`sudo`. This is necessary so that web servers, etc. can be reloaded.
+
The conditions for running using `sudo` are that the files have the
setuid bit set, that they be owned by root, that they be scripts and not
binaries, and that acmetool is not being run as root.
** Setup sudo. You will need to edit the sudoers file so that the hook
scripts (which you have inspected and trust) can be executed by
acmetool. It is essential that these have the `NOPASSWD` flag as the
scripts must be executable noninteractively.
+
`# visudo`
+
Add the line:
+
`acme ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/lib/acme/hooks/`
** Setup your challenge method:
+
*Webroot:* Make sure the `acme` user can write to the webroot directory
you configured.
+
*Redirector:* Make sure the directory `/var/run/acme/acme-challenge` is
writable by the `acme` user. `acmetool` puts challenges here because the
redirector looks here (internally it’s a glorified webroot mode).
+
Note that `/var/run` will be a tmpfs on many modern OSes, so the
directory ceases to exist on reboots. The redirector will try to create
the directory (as user root, mode 0755) if it doesn’t exist. This
happens before the redirector drops privileges from root. (It has to run
as root initially to bind to port 80.)
+
A configuration option has been added to make the redirector ensure that
the directory is writable by a certain group when starting up. When this
option is used, mode 0775 is used instead and the group owner is changed
to a given GID.
+
Pass `--challenge-gid=GID` to `acmetool redirector` (edit your service
manager’s configuration, e.g. the systemd unit file), where GID is the
numeric group ID of the group owner for the challenge directory
(i.e. the GID of the `acme` group). (Group names rather than IDs may be
supported on some platforms, but this is not guaranteed and will vary.
Use of a GID is recommended.)
+
*Proxy:* If you are using the proxy method, you won’t be able to listen
on port 402 as a non-root user. Use port 4402 instead, which acmetool
will try also try to use.
+
*Listener:* This is not usable under non-root operation unless you can
enable acmetool to bind to ports 80/443. On Linux you can do this by
running `setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /path/to/acmetool` as root.
Other POSIX platforms may have sysctls to allow non-root processes to
bind to low ports. However, this mode is not really useful for anything
other than development anyway.
+
*Hook:* See link:#challenge-hooks[Challenge Hooks].
